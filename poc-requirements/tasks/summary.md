## Effort Estimation

### Base Estimate
- **Total Hours**: 1,548
- **Contingency (20%)**: 310 hours
- **Total with Contingency**: 1,858 hours

### Team Composition
**Recommended 5-person core team**:
1. **Project Manager** (50%): 480 hours
2. **Solution Architect** (40%): 384 hours  
3. **Senior Developer - Custom Products** (100%): 960 hours
4. **Senior Developer - Integrations** (100%): 960 hours

- Data Migration Specialist (400 hours)

### Timeline Calculation
- **With 5-person team**: ~24 weeks (6 months)
- **Critical path duration**: 22 weeks minimum
- **Recommended duration**: 26 weeks (buffer included)

## Risk-Adjusted Planning

### High-Risk Tasks Requiring Extra Attention
1. **T001**: Legal Review - Blocks everything if negative
2. **T003**: Custom Product Prototype - 70% of business
3. **T012**: Full Configurator - Most complex feature
4. **T010**: Product Catalog Migration - 13,000 SKUs
5. **T024**: Final Migration - Go-live dependency

### Mitigation Strategies
- Front-load risky tasks (Sprint 0)
- Prototype before full implementation
- Parallel work streams where possible
- 20% contingency on all estimates
- Weekly risk reviews

## Success Metrics

### Sprint 0 Success Criteria
- [ ] Legal approval for data extraction
- [ ] Prototype proves configurator feasibility
- [ ] CSR workflow baselined
- [ ] Data extraction plan validated

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- [ ] All environments operational
- [ ] B2B account structure working
- [ ] 1,000 products migrated successfully
- [ ] Shipper HQ calculating rates

### Phase 2 Success Criteria
- [ ] Configurator handling all product types
- [ ] Payment processing all methods
- [ ] Compliance attributes searchable
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

### Phase 3 Success Criteria
- [ ] CSR order time < 30 seconds
- [ ] All integrations tested end-to-end
- [ ] Drop shipping automated
- [ ] Load testing passed

### Phase 4 Success Criteria
- [ ] All data migrated and validated
- [ ] UAT sign-off from all departments
- [ ] Team trained and confident
- [ ] Go-live checklist complete

## Budget Alignment

### Development Hours by Budget
- **Base hours**: 1,548 @ $125/hr = $193,500
- **With contingency**: 1,858 @ $125/hr = $232,250
- **Within budget**: No (exceeds $40-60K significantly)

### Budget Reality Check
**Options to fit budget**:
1. **MVP Approach**: Core features only (Phase 1-2) ~$100K
2. **Extended Timeline**: Smaller team, longer duration
3. **Phased Delivery**: Launch basic, enhance over time
4. **Budget Increase**: Recommended given complexity

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Present realistic budget needs to client
2. Prioritize MVP features if budget constrained
3. Start Sprint 0 tasks immediately
4. Secure dedicated team members

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Legal clearance** must happen first
2. **Custom product prototype** validates approach
3. **Dedicated resources** prevent context switching
4. **Stakeholder engagement** throughout process

### Go/No-Go Gates
- **After Sprint 0**: Prototype successful?
- **After Phase 1**: Core B2B working?
- **After Phase 2**: Performance acceptable?
- **Before Phase 4**: All integrations stable?

**Note**: This task breakdown assumes full implementation. If budget constraints exist, we recommend focusing on Phase 1-2 for MVP launch, then Phase 3-4 as budget allows.
