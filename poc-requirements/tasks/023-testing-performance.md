# Task 023: Performance Testing Suite

## Description
Conduct comprehensive load testing to validate system can handle 100 orders per minute during peak times while maintaining sub-2 second page load times and system stability.

## Requirements Reference
- 100 orders/minute peak capacity
- 2 second page load target
- 30 concurrent CSR users
- 500 concurrent shoppers
- Complex product configurations
- Real-time pricing calculations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Load test scripts created for all scenarios
- [ ] 100 orders/minute sustained for 1 hour
- [ ] Page load times <2s at peak load
- [ ] No errors during stress testing
- [ ] Database performance acceptable
- [ ] API response times within SLA
- [ ] CDN and caching optimized
- [ ] Performance baseline documented

## Technical Notes
- Use JMeter or Gatling for testing
- Test scenarios: browse, configure, checkout
- Monitor all system components
- Database query optimization
- Redis cache tuning
- CDN configuration optimization

## Effort Estimate
**60 hours** (7.5 days)

## Dependencies
- Production-like environment
- Realistic test data
- All integrations functional
- Monitoring tools setup

## Priority Level
**Critical** - Must validate before launch

## Risk Factors
- Unrealistic test scenarios
- Environment differences
- Third-party API limits
- Database scaling issues
