# Task: Build Custom Product Configuration Prototype

**ID**: T003  
**Category**: Setup & Risk Mitigation  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: TODO

## Description
Create a proof-of-concept for the most complex custom product configuration to validate technical approach and estimate actual complexity. This prototype will inform the full configurator development and help identify any technical blockers early.

## Requirements
- Reference: Product Configuration & Customization (CRITICAL)
- 70% of business is custom products
- 4-5 levels of customization affecting price
- Materials: polyvinyl, rigid vinyl, aluminum, etc.
- Size variations with radius options
- Hole drilling specifications
- Finishing options
- Compliance certifications

## Implementation Steps
1. Interview product team to identify most complex product
2. Document all customization rules and pricing logic
3. Set up Adobe Commerce development environment
4. Create prototype using:
   - Native configurable products
   - Custom options
   - Dynamic pricing rules
   - Visual configuration UI mockup
5. Test performance with various configurations
6. Validate pricing accuracy
7. Demo to stakeholders for feedback

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Most complex product identified and documented
- [ ] All customization rules mapped
- [ ] Working prototype in Adobe Commerce
- [ ] Pricing calculations validated
- [ ] Performance benchmarked
- [ ] Stakeholder demo completed
- [ ] Go/no-go decision on approach

## Acceptance Criteria
- Prototype handles all 4-5 customization levels
- Dynamic pricing updates in < 1 second
- Configuration can be saved and reordered
- Bulk ordering of configured items works
- Technical approach validated by architect

## Technical Notes
- Consider Magento 2 native capabilities first:
  - Configurable products for material variants
  - Custom options for specifications
  - Price rules for dynamic calculations
- Evaluate third-party solutions:
  - Product Designer Pro
  - Amasty Custom Options
  - Mageworx Advanced Product Options
- Performance considerations:
  - Cache configuration combinations
  - AJAX price updates
  - Optimize option dependencies

## Estimated Effort
- **Complexity**: Very High
- **Hours**: 80 hours (2 weeks)
- **Resources**: Senior Developer + Product Owner

## Dependencies
- **Depends on**: Product team availability
- **Blocks**: T012 (Full Custom Product Configurator)

## Risk Factors
- Customization logic more complex than expected
- Performance issues with many options
- May need custom development vs. native features
- Pricing rules might require external calculation

## Success Metrics
- Configuration time: < 30 seconds
- Price calculation: < 1 second
- All business rules implementable
- Scalable to 1000s of products

## Notes
This is the highest risk technical component. The prototype will determine if we can use native Magento features or need extensive custom development. Consider having Adobe Commerce solution consultant review the approach.
