# Requirements Review: Carlton USA

**Date**: 2025-07-03  
**Version Reviewed**: v1.0  
**Overall Status**: ðŸŸ¡ Yellow (Proceed with Cautions)

## Executive Summary

### PM Perspective
- **Schedule feasibility**: Feasible with conditions - 6-month timeline is aggressive but achievable with proper resource allocation
- **Resource needs**: 5-7 person team for 6 months minimum
- **Primary risks**: 
  1. Custom product configurator complexity underestimated
  2. Data extraction from vendor-locked system
  3. Parallel system costs during transition

### Architect Perspective  
- **Technical feasibility**: Feasible with conditions - all requirements achievable with Adobe Commerce B2B
- **Architecture readiness**: 8/10
- **Technical risks**: 
  1. Legacy data migration from ASP.NET
  2. Complex product customization rules
  3. Multi-system integration orchestration

## Detailed Findings

### ðŸŸ¢ Strengths
Well-defined areas:

1. **Business Goals & Pain Points**: Crystal clear on why they need change - vendor lock-in, shipping errors, payment issues
2. **B2B Requirements**: Excellent articulation of buyer/payer/ship-to complexity
3. **Budget Reality**: Clear understanding of current spend ($27K/month) and implementation budget ($40-60K)
4. **Compliance Requirements**: Good identification of DOT/OSHA/Hazmat needs
5. **Phased Approach**: Logical 4-phase implementation plan

### ðŸŸ¡ Recommendations
Areas to enhance:

| Section | Current State | Recommendation | Priority |
|---------|--------------|----------------|----------|
| **Virtual Catalogs** | Mentioned but undefined | Define if PDF generation or interactive experience | HIGH |
| **Sample Workflow** | Feature exists, process unknown | Map complete sample request-to-fulfillment process | HIGH |
| **Production Management** | 70% custom but no detail | Define production tracking & customer communication needs | HIGH |
| **Payment Distribution** | "Big chunk" EDI/ACH | Get exact percentages for architecture planning | MEDIUM |
| **Order History Migration** | Timeframe undefined | Define how many years of history needed | MEDIUM |
| **Email Platform** | TBD platform | Identify current platform for migration planning | MEDIUM |
| **Success Metrics** | Some vague (e.g., "profitable") | Define specific $ targets and KPIs | LOW |

### ðŸ”´ Critical Gaps
Must address before proceeding:

1. **Data Extraction Strategy**
   - Issue: Vendor has triple lock-in (website, OMS, Dynamics)
   - Impact: Could block or severely delay migration
   - Resolution: Legal review of contract + technical extraction plan ASAP

2. **Custom Product Configurator Complexity**
   - Issue: 4-5 customization levels mentioned but logic unknown
   - Impact: Could require 2-3x estimated development time
   - Resolution: Deep dive session with product team + prototype highest complexity item

3. **CSR Workflow Details**
   - Issue: "Sub-30 second order lookup" but current process undefined
   - Impact: Cannot validate if target achievable
   - Resolution: Shadow CSRs for a day, time current processes

## Project Viability Assessment

### Triple Constraint Analysis
```
        SCOPE
         /\
        /  \
       /    \
      /      \
   TIME ---- COST

Current balance: Scope-heavy with tight budget
Recommendation: Consider MVP scope reduction or budget increase
```

### Go/No-Go Recommendation

**Verdict**: Proceed with Cautions

Conditions:
- [x] Client commitment confirmed (pain is real)
- [x] Adobe Commerce B2B can meet core needs
- [ ] Data extraction path must be validated
- [ ] Custom product complexity must be prototyped
- [ ] Additional 20% budget buffer recommended

## Risk-Adjusted Planning

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Early Vendor Extraction**
   - Why critical: Current vendor has triple lock-in
   - How to ensure: Legal review + parallel data export starting day 1

2. **Custom Product Prototype**
   - Why critical: 70% of business, highest complexity
   - How to ensure: Sprint 0 dedicated to configurator proof-of-concept

3. **Stakeholder Buy-in**
   - Why critical: 5 departments affected, only 2 engaged so far
   - How to ensure: Demos with each department before Phase 2

### Major Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|------------|---------|------------|-------|
| Data extraction blocked | MEDIUM | HIGH | Legal review, manual export backup plan | PM + Legal |
| Custom product complexity | HIGH | HIGH | Early prototype, iterative development | Architect |
| Integration delays | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Parallel track, vendor engagement | Tech Lead |
| Staff adoption resistance | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Early training, change champions | PM |
| Budget overrun | MEDIUM | HIGH | 20% buffer, phased delivery | PM |

## Resource Recommendations
